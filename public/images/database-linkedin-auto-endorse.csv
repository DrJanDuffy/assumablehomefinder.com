Working her way to being recognized within the top 1% of Realtors the the Toronto Real Estate Board,  for Kathleen it was only the beginning. 

Kathleen quickly realized that her success was attributed to programs that she had developed internally over years of perfecting her craft as an Agent. Recognizing the demand for such programs, Kathleen set out to work on further developing each system and building out a robust platform of educational programs and coaching methods designed to provide Real Estate Agents with the tools and techniques needed to progress forward both personally and professionally. In 2015, Kathleen Black Coaching & Consulting (KBCC) was formed. 

With the launch of KBCC and building upon her 10+ years of Team and Agent development and guidance, hundreds of teams have attributed their growth and success to Kathleen’s leadership either directly or through one of her coaching programs. Her credibility and understanding of the Real Estate market has guided countless teams to be Top 1% Producers. 

The success of KBCC centers around integrity, honesty, and results-driven measures, the very things that represent Kathleen. Her “practice what you preach” mantra has served both herself and her clients well with over 80% of them at the top 1% of production across the country. 

If being a CEO, development coach, professional speaker, and educator weren’t enough, Kathleen is also a dedicated mother and has been named one of the Top 100 Elite Women Driving the Future of Real Estate by REP Magazine, and in 2018 as one of the Top 20 Emerging Leaders by T3 Sixty.
